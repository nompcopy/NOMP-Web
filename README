To start the project, you should:
1. Get your node.js ready in your pc, you may download the node.js install file on the web site, or you may use git shell to down load node.js like this:
    npm install -g express
    To make sure that all the dependencies are installed, I recommande do this for the first time:
    npm install
2. Get your MongoDB ready, this may take a while cause MongoDB allocate more storage:
    http://mongodb.org/

Note: Each time you run a test session in your local server, you should run two thing:
    mongod --dbpath ~/Web/model # This will get you database ready and where we store the models in database
    express server.js # This will launch your local server with a port (usually 3000, according to the server configuration)
